## lib/core/frameworks

Put code here that is primarily for interfacing with 3rd-party libraries and frameworks.

A judgement call will have to be made for code that would normally otherwise be in lib/core/entities, or some other top-level folder, but is very tightly coupled with / dependent on particular 3rd-party libraries and frameworks.
